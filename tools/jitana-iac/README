IAC_Location
Files Created:

IAC_LOC:
Scripts:
1. launch_sr_loc.sh: Run all the apps from a location

Code:
1. resource_shared_graph.hpp: checks for implicit and explicit intents, parsing
   and loading of manifest file, writing the graphs using graphviz
2. main.cpp: load manifest and then create all the graphs(for analysis added to
   the resource shared graph)

Buiding IAC_Loc is Same as jitana:
cd build
cmake ../jitana
make -j* ( where * depends on the number of cores, usually j4 to j8)
mkdir ../dex/aut
mkdir ../dex/aut/extracted

To run IAC_Loc:
Go to build folder and run
$ source ./launch_sr_loc.sh  ../dex/aut/iac_loc_in/jitana_poc > ${PWD}/log.txt
1. Location of the apks= ../dex/aut/iac_loc_in/jitana_poc (there are many
   applications in the folder iac_loc_in)
2. Logfile = ${PWD}/log.txt = build/log.txt
3. Resource Shared Graph is created in build/output/resource_sharing_graph.dot
   (This is the additional graph created by the plugin on top of jitana_core)


Device_Analysis_in_BYOD:
Scripts:
1. launch_sr_device.sh : Run all the apps from a device

Code:
1. resource_shared_graph.hpp: implicit and explicit intents, parsing and
   loading a manifest file, writing the graphs using graphviz
2. main.cpp: load manifest and then create all the graphs(for analysis added
   the resource shared graph)

Buiding IAC_Device is Same as jitana:
cd build
cmake ../jitana
make -j* ( where * depends on the number of cores, usually j4 to j8)
mkdir ../dex/aut
mkdir ../dex/aut/extracted

To run IAC_Device:
Go to build folder and run
source ./launch_sr_device.sh > ${PWD}/log.txt
1. Logfile = ${PWD}/log.txt = build/log.txt
2. Resource Shared Graph is created in build/output/resource_sharing_graph.dot (This is the additional graph created by the plugin on top of jitana_core)


Notes: IAC is not mature yet as it handles only implicit and explicit intents.
We are working on building a taint analysis and this IAC with other components(Broadcast recievers, Content Providers and Services) and adding other inter application resources like files which will be our future work.
